NXP PCF85363 Real Time Clock
============================

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain "nxp,pcf85363".
- reg: I2C address for chip.

Optional properties:
- interrupts: IRQ line for the RTC (not implemented).

- nxp,rtc-interrupt-type: integer property, represent the interrupt's
  type. Valid values are
  INT_PIE(periodic interrupt enable),
  INT_OIE(offset correction interrupt enable),
  INT_A1IE(alarm1 interrupt enable),
  INT_A2IE(alarm2 interrupt enable),
  INT_TSRIE(timestamp register interrupt enable)
  INT_BSIE(battery switch interrupt enable),
  INT_WDIE(WatchDog interrupt enable,and
  compose these values such as: INT_A1IE | INT_A2IE,
  but currently only support INT_A1IE, default value is INT_A1IE.
  The property and property nxp,rtc-interrupt-output-pin
  work together to generate some interrupts on some pins.

- nxp,rtc-interrupt-output-pin: The interrupt output pin must be
  "INTA" or "INTB", default value is "INTA". The property and property
  nxp,rtc-interrupt-type work together to generate some interrupts on
  some pins.

- quartz-load-femtofarads: The internal capacitor to select for the quartz,
  expressed in femto Farad (fF). Valid values are 6000, 7000 and 12500.
  Default value is 12500fF.

- quartz-drive-strength-ohms: Drive strength for the quartz,
  expressed in ohm, Valid values are 60000, 100000 and 500000.
  Default value is 100000 ohm.

- nxp,quartz-low-jitter: Boolean property, if present enables low jitter mode
  which reduces jitter at the cost of increased power consumption.

- wakeup-source: Boolean property, Please refer to
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/wakeup-source.txt

Example:

pcf85363: pcf85363@51 {
	compatible = "nxp,pcf85363";
	reg = <0x51>;

	interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
	interrupts = <18 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;

	wakeup-source;
	nxp,rtc-interrupt-output-pin = "INTA";
	nxp,rtc-interrupt-type = <INT_A1IE>;
	quartz-load-femtofarads = <12500>;
	quartz-drive-strength-ohms = <60000>;
	nxp,quartz-low-jitter;
};
